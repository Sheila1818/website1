            <h4><strong> History of Somalia: </strong> </h4>
            
            <p id = "rcorners1">Somalia is a country that has <em>experienced</em> excessive amounts of political instability during the past decade. Somalia, like most other countries in Africa, was colonized by European nations during the late 1800s. In 1887, Britain became concerned with keeping the route to India open through the Suez Canal, which was opened in 1869 and as a result Britain proclaimed Somalia as a British protectorate and named it British Somaliland. Somalia's transformation into an independent state was peaceful in the beginning but is soon erupted into a violent conflict. In 1969 Abdi Rashid Ali Shirmarke, Somalia's second President, was assassinated and in the following days a military coup, led by Major General Muhammed Siyad Barre, tgained control of the country. In 1970 Barre declared Somalia to be a socialist state.Somalia currently has no stable government and many of the areas of the country continue to be under self-rule with control held by local leaders. Somalia is a country comprised of roughly 7.5 million people, many of who are nomads or refugees. The establishment of a government has proved to be extremely difficult and currently Somalia remains a lawless nation.</p>
